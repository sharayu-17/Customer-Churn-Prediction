# Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains resources and project files for predicting customer churn in the credit card industry. The project aims to identify customers at high risk of leaving, enabling businesses to implement strategies to improve customer retention and satisfaction.

## Project Objective
Customer churn prediction is a critical challenge for industries like banking, fintech, telecommunications, and retail. By identifying at-risk customers, companies can take proactive measures to enhance loyalty and reduce churn, ultimately improving profitability and long-term customer value.

## Files in This Repository
1. **Customer Churn Prediction.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for customer churn prediction. This includes:
   - Data preprocessing and cleaning
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Machine learning model implementation
   - Model evaluation using metrics like confusion matrix and feature importance
   - Visualizations such as heatmaps, scatter plots, and box plots to understand churn trends

2. **`BankChurners.csv`**  
   This dataset contains detailed information about credit card customers, including demographic attributes, transaction behaviors, and churn status.

## Methodology
